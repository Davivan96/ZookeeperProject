# ZookeeperProject

This is the first project of Jetbrains Academy python for beginners course. 

## What do I learn in this project?

I learned how to manipulate python lists with their main functions and how to use control flow tools like while, for and if statements. 

The script was coded with PEP8 best practices guidelines.
